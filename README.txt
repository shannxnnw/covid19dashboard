COVID-19 Dashboard

------------------------------------------------------

This project is the idea to create a working, personalised COVID-19 dashboard.
It takes information about COVID infection rates from Public Health England API and news stories about covid from a news API.

## General Information

This project is incomplete, clearly. The flask template does not embed the APIs as I simply never worked out how to.
Although, I managed to use the news API and Public Health England API to show infection rates and article headlines from the BBC in Exeter.

---------------------------------------------------------

## Installation

Installation of Flask (I used Windows):
***
Flask is the web template used for the dashboard. It provides a GUI which includes scheduling of new news articles which can be
requested by the user of the application.
***
> mkdir myproject
> cd myproject
> py -3 -m venv venv
$  pip install Flask

##FAQs
-------------------------------------------------------

Is the project complete?
Nope, as mentioned above, I did not manage to complete a few things such as embedding the APIs into the flask template.
I just simply never learnt how to, which I do plan on doing in the future as it is bothering me.
